- ðŸ‘‹ Heya!, Iâ€™m @hippo23. A Computer Science student studying in the Philippines at UP Diliman. This github mainly contains my repositories, both for personal projects and also formal, business-related ones.
- ðŸ’¡ If you need to know, I mainly do back-end things. NodeJS, databases, and to a lesser extent, Authentication and even DevOps. I love the nitty-gritty that I get from these tasks, and can get really passionate about the right ones.
- ðŸ“‡ Feel free to send me a message or email! I freelance, and even if you aren't sure about what you want, I don't mind hearing ideas.
